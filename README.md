# This a first leetcode problem i solved 
The method i learned during this problem is Two-way pointer .the given string is converted into list and we take pointer at starting  and another at ending and check for a condition and swap them 
that's all.when we finished we will join the list back to string.this can be done even more easily using string slice operation.
