# This is another question I faced in the same Tcs NQT Exam
I don't want to talk about my life story because I am not good at typing so,my fingers are becoming little painful.

# question asked : To output a word which has a highest length from the sentence
example:
input: The sun rises in the east.
output: 5
Here the word with the highest length is "rises" so the outpuut is 5.
It varies according to he input.
